Project Overview:

This project is a Recycling Machine application developed in Java, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. 
The application provides a simple Swing GUI where users can deposit recyclable items such as cans, bottles, and crates, and calculate the total refund value. The program also generates a receipt listing the deposited items and their values.
This assignment demonstrates the implementation of core OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. The GUI is built using Swing JFrame for user interaction.

Features:
-Deposit various types of recyclable items: Cans, Bottles, and Crates.
-Calculate the total refund value based on the number of items deposited.
-Display a receipt listing the deposited items with individual and total values.
-Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing.

Technologies Used:
-Java (Core logic)
-Swing (Graphical User Interface)
-VSCode (Development Environment)
-Git & GitHub (Version Control)
